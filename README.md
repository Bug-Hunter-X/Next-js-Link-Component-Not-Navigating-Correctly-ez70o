# Next.js Link Component Not Navigating Correctly

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Next.js's Link component where links fail to navigate properly, despite routes seemingly being defined correctly. This can stem from various issues like incorrect path specifications, missing page files, or client-side routing problems. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the fix.

## Problem

The `Link` component in `bug.js` appears to be correctly configured to navigate to `/` and `/about`. However, clicking these links might not trigger navigation, instead causing the page to refresh or display an error. This might be due to issues with `next/link` usage or the configuration of the Next.js project.

## Solution

The solution, found in `bugSolution.js`, addresses these potential problems. It includes essential code changes that ensure the navigation works as intended.  The fix may involve checking for typos in paths, ensuring the existence of corresponding page files, and addressing possible issues in the Next.js configuration.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
4. Observe the faulty navigation in `bug.js` and then the corrected navigation in `bugSolution.js`.
